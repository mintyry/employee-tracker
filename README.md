# ManageCo

## Description üì∞

ManageCo allows the user to track employee data for the company. User will see organized data pertaining to departments, roles, and employees and may update data as necessary.  

The motivation behind this app is for any company to easily sort their company data.
This solves the problem of knowing which employees are in which department, who they report to, how much they make, etc. -- all pertinent information for a company to manage their data and keep themselves organized.

In making this app, I learned a lot! I have learned more about using callback functions and .then()s, and was able to realize I can chain on so much actions within each other to provide more flexibility in options presented to the user via Inquirer.prompt().
I learned about conditional chaining and short circuiting, which I understand will be common in more real-world applications. Up until this point, I've only used Inquirer on its own, and this app shed light that I can use it anytime in functions.  

Building this app inspired a lot of creative thinking and logic, which I am proud to share in the form of ManageCo!

Due to the structure of this assignment's instructions, the base features were all included in the main menu; most of the bonus features were added in the submenus for coherent and convenient access for the user.  
The following image is an example of the master employees table when user chooses to "view all employees"; included in this image is the submenu for that feature.
